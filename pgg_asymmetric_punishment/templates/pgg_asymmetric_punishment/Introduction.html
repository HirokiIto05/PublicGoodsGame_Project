<h3>New Rule: Democratic Punishment</h3>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <strong>The punishment rule has changed.</strong><br>
    You will now <strong>propose</strong> punishment, and then the group will <strong>vote</strong> on whether it is executed.
</div>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Proposal:</strong> You may propose punishment points for other players (max <strong>9</strong> total).</li>
    <li><strong>Cost/Fine:</strong> If executed, each point costs the proposer <strong>1</strong> and reduces the target’s payoff by <strong>2</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Voting:</strong> Punishment is executed only if at least <strong>2 out of 3</strong> other players vote “Yes”.</li>
</ul>
