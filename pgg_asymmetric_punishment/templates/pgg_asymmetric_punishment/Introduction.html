<p>
    In this experiment, you will repeatedly play a public goods game in a group of
    {{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }} participants.
</p>

<p>
    In each round, you receive an endowment of points. You can decide how many points
    to contribute to the group project and how many to keep for yourself.
</p>

<p>
    The total contributions of all group members are multiplied by {{ C.MULTIPLIER }}
    and then divided equally among all group members, regardless of their individual
    contributions.
</p>

<p>
    In some rounds, a punishment system may be available. Depending on the punishment
    system, group members can punish each other (peer punishment) or punishment may be
    imposed automatically by a rule (central punishment).
</p>

<p>
    Your earnings in the experiment will depend on your own decisions and the decisions
    of the other group members.
