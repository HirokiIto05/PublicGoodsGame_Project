<h3>Democratic Punishment</h3>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    The punishment rule has changed.
</div>

<ul>
    <li>You may <strong>propose</strong> punishment points for other players (max <strong>9</strong> total).</li>
    <li>If executed, each point costs the proposer <strong>1</strong> and reduces the target’s payoff by <strong>2</strong>.</li>
    <li>For each player, the other group members vote.</li>
    <li>Punishment is executed only if at least <strong>2 out of 3</strong> voters approve.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Unlike peer punishment, punishment is implemented only after a <strong>majority vote</strong>.
